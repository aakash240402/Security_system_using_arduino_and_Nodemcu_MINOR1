# Security System using Arduino and NodeMCU
- Our project consists of a temperature sensor and metal sensor in a gate, which can be integrated in the existing metal detecting gates present in areas like malls, shopping complexes, airports, bus and railway stations etc.
- The temperature sensor present in the gate would measure the temperature without a person to operate it while simultaneously detecting metal components when the person is passing through the gate. If the personâ€™s temperature is higher than the permissible range, they would be asked to give their contact details such as email id and address. Then a cautionary mail will be sent to people.
- The existing technology and equipment in the market are costly and not Smart or IOT based devices, which means that our equipment is far more technologically advanced, while being cost effective. Not just cost effective, our project has very low running cost as it does not require additional people to be hired in order to operate it.
